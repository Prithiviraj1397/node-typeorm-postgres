        "Hatchbacks are India's most frequent vehicle type. It has a tiny body, four doors, and a boot. These vehicles can accommodate up to five people.

        'Multi-utility vehicles (MUVs) or multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) are designed to be as practical and useful as possible. Because of its ability to carry up to ten passengers, a MUV vehicle is commonly called a people carrier.

        'SUV is a car body type that includes both passenger vehicles and off-roaders. It is very popular in the Indian market. SUVs are typically huge and measure well over 4 meters, with tiny SUVs being the exception, measuring less than 4 meters. SUVs, with their towering body-line, give the driver a commanding view of the road ahead. Furthermore, SUVs feature high ground clearance, which allows for superior terrain handling and a higher stance from the ground. This trait distinguishes them from all other vehicle body styles.',

      description:
        'Convertible automobiles have a roof-line that may be removed or replaced as needed. It is typically found in high-end luxury vehicles. Roof lines are folded step by step using electromechanical mechanisms. Earlier automobiles were made of leather. Metal roof lines on current automobiles are designed to fold part by part and eventually rest on/in the trunk of the vehicle. The operation of a button is sufficient for folding or repositioning the roof linings.',

The two doors are slightly larger, and while a rear seat is offered in some variants, one can access the interior by moving the front seats. The emphasis here is on styling, elegance, and image. Coupe design is generally used in European countries, and while it is available in India, the number of people who favour this kind is extremely small',
